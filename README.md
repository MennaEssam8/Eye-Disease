# INTRODUCTION
Eye diseases encompass a wide range of conditions and disorders that can cause visual impairment or vision loss. These conditions can result from genetics, age, environmental factors, or underlying medical conditions. Common eye diseases include glaucoma, characterized by increased intraocular pressure and potential optic nerve damage, cataracts, which cloud the eye's natural lens and lead to blurred vision, and diabetic retinopathy, a condition in individuals with diabetes where high blood sugar damages retinal blood vessels, potentially causing vision loss if not treated

# AIM AND OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately identifies and categorizes eye diseases from medical images. This project aims to achieve objectives such as disease identification, accuracy, early detection, efficiency, real-world applicability, generalization, ethical compliance, interpretability, continual learning, and validation. In essence, it strives to develop a reliable and adaptable system for healthcare professionals to diagnose and manage eye diseases, emphasizing accuracy, efficiency, early detection, ethical considerations, and practical use in clinical settings


# Eye Diseases
- Glaucoma: Group of eye diseases that can damage the Optic nerve, Optic nerve is responsible for transmitting visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss and, in some cases, Blindness

- Diabetic retinopathy: It's an Eye condition that affects people with diabetes. High blood sugar leaves damaged vessels in the retina (The retina is that part of your eyes that can detect light and send signals to the brain). Damage to these blood vessels can lead to vision loss and Blindness in some cases.

- Cataracts: Cataracts cloud the natural eye lens, leading to blurry vision and difficulty seeing clearly. Aging is one of the main reasons for this disease, but it can also be caused by factors such as injury, genetics, or medication effects. Cataracts can make natural vision blurry, cloudy, and even double it.

# ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset consists of retinal images of different classes. These images are collected from various sorces like IDRiD, Oculur recognition, HRF etc. The number of images for each class is as follows:

- Cataract = 1038 images
- Glaucoma = 1007 images
- Normal = 1074 images
- Diabetic retinopathy = 1098 images

By better understanding these eye diseases, their causes, and their effects on vision, we can develop insights to aid their early detection and effective management. This notebook tries to classify these diseases from pictures.
